# 📚 User Stories – Airbnb Clone Documentation

This folder contains **user stories** derived from the Airbnb Clone use‑case diagram.  
User stories capture functional requirements from the perspective of real actors (Guests, Hosts, Admins, and external services).

## 🎯 Objective

> **Task 4:** Translate each use‑case into a concise, actionable user story.  
> *Format example:*  
> **“As a \<role>, I want to \<goal> so that \<benefit>.”*

These stories guide backlog creation, sprint planning, and acceptance‑test design.
